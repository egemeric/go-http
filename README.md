# go-http
my first golang code

## Works on http://127.0.0.1:8008/  
**you have to run executable files on prejects root folder**(move exec file from bulid, to upper dir) it runs arm & x86_64 you dont have to install any package.   
but because of the windows's filepath architecture it doesn't work now on windows :D   
### URLS: 

http://127.0.0.1:8008/edit/<any_name>   -> edit any page it has not any user management system so **everyone can cahange your site:D**   
http://127.0.0.1:8008/view/<any_name>   -> you can view and change the page. 

### CSS
